# SolarPowerRoofTopPotential
A tool to  calculate the potential of Roof top solar power based on historical weather data and open source geodata 

## Walkthrough of the example Jupyter Notebook
When providing .tif file of the built up area, a .gpkg file of the region of interest, .csv or excel files for domestic hot water and space heating demand as well as COP values for Heat pumps or other power to heat technologies a user is able to calculate the potential of solar thermal heating and PV powered Heat Pump heating.
The .tif file for the built up area used in the example can be repurposed for other analysis besides the shown example.
